== Generating a Self-Signed Certificate

NOTE: PKCS12: Public Key Cryptographic Standards is a password protected format that can contain multiple certificates and keys; it's an industry-wide used format

We can use either of keytool to generate the certificates from the command line. Keytool is shipped with Java Runtime Environment.

=== Generating a keystore and self-signed cerificates

Now we'll create a set of cryptographic keys and store it in a keystore.
We can use the following command to generate our PKCS12 keystore format:

	keytool -genkeypair -alias kong -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore kong.p12 -validity 3650
 
	openssl pkcs12 -in kong.p12 -nocerts -out kong.key
	openssl pkcs12 -in kong.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out kong.crt
	openssl rsa -in kong.key -out kong.key 
	
NOTE: remember these passwords, they will be needed in the future (password: kong123)
